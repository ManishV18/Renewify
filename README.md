## **Machine Learning in Global Energy Sustainability**

### Objective

The objective of the project is to revolutionize global energy sustainability through innovative machine learning techniques. Its goal is to predict renewable trends, analyze CO2 impacts, and provide useful insights by leveraging data from various sources. The goal is to provide useful information for informed decision-making in the pursuit of a sustainable future.

### Introduction

Energy is an essential part of our daily lives, influencing economic growth, environmental health, and the well-being of people around the world. Transitioning to sustainable energy sources is more important than ever before as traditional practices that have been followed throughout the years contribute more to environmental degradation and climate change. Our world depends on energy to run everything from our automobiles, factories to our household appliances. However, how we generate this energy has a significant impact on the worldâ€™s future and the choices we make in energy production impact the air we breathe, the climate we experience, and the well-being of future generations.

### Dataset Collection

The data collection method employed involves querying Wikipedia pages using the Wikipedia API. The program interacts with Wikipedia's database, retrieving information about specified titles such as carbon dioxide emissions and renewable electricity production. It parses the HTML content of these pages to extract relevant data, enabling analysis and presentation of information on a country-by-country basis.
